## Notes on diagnostics 

## Burden 

- Dust and sea salt burden values are very low, but it's expected (weaker surface winds in ne4pg2).
- Sulfate burden is extremely high, with high values over North Africa. Better to double check the initial condition.
- Global mean burden values are almost the same (some rounding errors might exist), indicating mass is overall conserved.
