## Description 

This header file contains two functions for vertical interpolation and rebinning, designed for parallel execution in atmospheric models. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements:

vert_interp Function:

	•	Purpose: This function performs vertical interpolation between levels of atmospheric data. It’s based on the original tracer_data.F90 routine but parallelized with Kokkos::parallel_for for efficient computation across multiple columns and levels.
	•	Key Parameters:
	•	levsiz: Number of levels in the input data.
	•	pver: Number of levels in the interpolated data.
	•	pin: Input pressure levels.
	•	pmid: Mid-point pressure levels for interpolation.
	•	datain: Input data corresponding to pin levels.
	•	dataout: Output interpolated data.
The function interpolates based on the pressure levels, handling three cases:
	1.	If the mid-point pressure is less than the minimum input pressure, it scales linearly.
	2.	If the mid-point pressure exceeds the maximum input pressure, it assigns the last value.
	3.	Otherwise, it interpolates between two adjacent pressure levels using linear interpolation.

rebin Function:

	•	Purpose: This function rebins data from a source grid to a target grid, using integration over the source grid to calculate values for the target grid.
	•	Key Parameters:
	•	nsrc: Number of source points.
	•	ntrg: Number of target points.
	•	src_x: Source grid points (e.g., pressure or altitude levels).
	•	trg_x: Target grid points.
	•	src: Data on the source grid.
	•	trg: Output rebinned data.
The function computes the target values by determining overlapping regions between source and target grid points and integrating over those regions.

Notes:

	•	Parallelization: Both functions use Kokkos’ parallel execution model (TeamVectorRange) for performance.
	•	Error Handling: Division by zero is explicitly checked using EKAT_KERNEL_ASSERT_MSG, ensuring stability.

This implementation is designed for efficiency and accuracy in large-scale atmospheric models, especially in the MAM (Model for Aerosol Microphysics) context. Let me know if you need more details on any part!
